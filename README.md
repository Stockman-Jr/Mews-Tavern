# Agile Methodology

An agile approach was implemented for this project with a Github projects kanban board which can be found [here](https://github.com/users/Stockman-Jr/projects/3/views/1?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C%22Assignees%22%2C%22Status%22%2C%22Labels%22%5D).

## Design

### Colour scheme

The colour palette chosen for this project are hues of brown, beige, blue and gold.

![Colour Palette]()

It's a colour palette I'm very fond of, but it was a bit tricky to use in terms of creating contrast and readability.

### Typography

The main font of the site is a standard font, 'Trebuchet MS'. I also used a Google Font, 'Press 2 Play', which was used as a decorative font, mostly used in headings throughout the application.

### Imagery

### Responsive Design

The responsiveness of the site was achieved through the use of bootstrap, flexbox and media queries.
